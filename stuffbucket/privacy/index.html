        <h1>Privacy Policy for StuffBucket</h1>
        <p>
          StuffBucket is a personal capture app for links, snippets, and documents. This policy
          explains what data is processed and where it goes.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Data you provide</h2>

          <li>Imported files and documents</li>
          <li>Tags, collections, titles, and metadata</li>

          <li>App data is stored on device.</li>
          <li>
            If iCloud sync is enabled for the app, data is synced through your Apple iCloud account
            using CloudKit.
          </li>
          <li>CloudKit container: <code>iCloud.com.digitalhandstand.stuffbucketapp</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Link archiving and network activity</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you save a link, StuffBucket may fetch the web page and related assets to create a
            local archive copy.
          </li>
          <li>This network activity is initiated by your save/import actions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Optional AI features (user initiated)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>AI features are optional and only run when you trigger them.</li>
          <li>Supported providers include OpenAI and Anthropic.</li>
          <li>
            Content sent for AI processing can include item title, snippet text, URL, and archived
            text excerpts relevant to the request as well as attached documents.
          </li>
          <li>
            You provide your own API key. Keys are stored on-device and can be synced via your
            Apple account key-value storage depending on your device settings.

        <h2>6. Retention and deletion</h2>
